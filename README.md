##About
The kids bought a handful of old school 4 digit 7 segment bubble displays.
They are low power, and perfect for adding scrolling text displays to your
electronics projects.

One display takes up 12 GPIO outputs on our Raspberry Pi so it was an ideal
opportunity to learn about shift registers. At 50pence each they didn't make
much of a hole in their pocket money, and we managed to drive 2 bubble displays
(8 digits) with only 3 GPIO pins. You could drive even more if you wanted.

You could use the shift registers to operate an LED matrix, a row of regular
LEDs or make your own 4 digit 7 segment diaplay from 4 of the common 7 segment
numberical displays.

Code is Python, and the wiring is explained. It's a very simple project, ideal
for kids. We'd love to get our hands on a TSA1605A and do something similar.
